# Brew is completely broken.  Attempt to fix it:
brew() { CONFIG_SITE= GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null command brew "$@"; }

# In particular, allowing core.hooksPath to be set causes all
# sorts of potential breakage.  brew regularly clones repos
# and attempts to run a configure script, and most packages are
# not robust
