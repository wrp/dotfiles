Fix git-completions so that "git -C /p/a<tab>" works.  Currently,
if not in a git repo, that will through error messages.  As an
optional feature, make "git -C /p/a/t/h cmd /fil<tab>" expand in
the proper directory. (partly implemented)

Perhaps add an option to git-log-oneline to allow control of the
trailer truncation.


Cleanup the recovery of COMMIT_EDITMSG.  It is convenient to have previous
message, but still occasionally pollutes the log (it doesn't handle
rebase/amend/etc. very well).  Meybe just store the old file and
get in the habit of remembering that it is in COMMIT_EDITMSG.bak

Make the ciam alias smarter.  If there are staged changes,
then invoking ciam is probably a mistake and the user
intended to just do ci.   I think the correct behavior
will be to run commit without -a and emit a warning.


Make tab-expansion for vi ignore files that are ignored by git.


Split up .vimrc so it just looks something like:
for f in split(glob('~/.config/vim/plugin/*.vim'), '\n')
	execute 'source' f
endfor

Move all of the bash config files into ~/.config/bash

Get rid of ~/.config/$USER; move everything currently there up one level.
