Clean up gitconfig for logging.  Need to make l take
options like l1 does and implement all the other aliases
in terms of l (or just purge the l garbage and always
use l1)


Maybe use something like:
 git rev-list HEAD~1 | xargs -n 1 git for-each-ref refs/heads/ --points-at
to decide which ref to show default diff against.  That is, rather than
using $(git config diff.base-branch) to decide which branch, check the
current history and diff against the most recent branch tip.
