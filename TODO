Stop using multivar for trailer configs.  Git makes it impossible
for a repo to completely override the global config, so we should
instead use a single value, perhaps comma separated.


Make find-commit be a boolean "and". If we have multiple blobs, filter
the commits and only display the ones that match all.  This is better
functionality and should be far more efficient since we can restrict
the git-log --find-object to previously found treeish

Cleanup the revocery of COMMIT_EDITMSG.  It is convenient to have previous
message, but still occasionally pollutes the log (it doesn't handle
rebase/amend/etc. very well).  Meybe just store the old file and
get in the habit of remembering that it is in COMMIT_EDITMSG.bak

Make the ciam alias smarter.  If there are staged changes,
then invoking ciam is probably a mistake and the user
intended to just do ci.   I think the correct behavior
will be to run commit without -a and emit a warning.


Make tab-expansion for vi ignore files that are ignored by git.


Split up .vimrc so it just looks something like:
for f in split(glob('~/.config/vim/plugin/*.vim'), '\n')
	execute 'source' f
endfor
