Make find-commit be a boolean and. If we have multiple blobs, filter
the commits and only display the ones that match all.  This is better

the git-log --find-object to previously found treeish

Make the ciam alias smarter.  If there are staged changes,
then invoking ciam is probably a mistake and the user
intended to just do ci.   I think the correct behavior
will be to run commit without -a and emit a warning.

for f in split(glob('~/.config/vim/plugin/*.vim'), '\n')
	execute 'source' f
endfor
