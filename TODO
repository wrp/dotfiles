I was able to push wip.  Track down why pre-push did not fail.

Also track down why previously edited commit messages are making it
into the log.

Make find-commit be a boolean "and". If we have multiple blobs, filter
the commits and only display the ones that match all.  This is better
functionality and should be far more efficient since we can restrict
the git-log --find-object to previously found treeish

Stash COMMIT_EDITMSG.  Probably in die() in common-hook functions.  The
problem is, if you do a commit --amend and the hook rejects it, you
have usually made edits.  But when you do commit --amend again, that
overwrite COMMIT_EDITMSG and the changes are lost.  If the hook
script stashes a copy somehwere, you can re-use  the previous edits.

Make the ciam alias smarter.  If there are staged changes,
then invoking ciam is probably a mistake and the user
intended to just do ci.   I think the correct behavior
will be to run commit without -a and emit a warning.


Make tab-expansion for vi ignore files that are ignored by git.


Split up .vimrc so it just looks something like:
for f in split(glob('~/.config/vim/plugin/*.vim'), '\n')
	execute 'source' f
endfor
