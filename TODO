Make the ciam alias smarter.  If there are staged changes,
then invoking ciam is probably a mistake and the user
intended to just do ci.   I think the correct behavior
will be to run commit without -a and emit a warning.


Make tab-expansion for vi ignore files that are ignored by git.


Split up .vimrc so it just looks something like:
for f in split(glob('~/.config/vim/plugin/*.vim'), '\n')
	execute 'source' f
endfor
