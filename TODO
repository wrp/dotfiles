Make tab-expansion for vi ignore files that are ignored by git.

Allow trailer width to be dynamic.  eg, rather than w=5, allow
something like w=5,3,4 to specify differing widths for
each tab.  Perhaps make the width depend on the name
of the trailer, or (more computational) check the values
in the log to determine the width.
